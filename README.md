## 📜 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset. Fraud detection is crucial for financial institutions to minimize losses. By leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and Logistic Regression, this project aims to build an effective model for identifying fraud.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is a collection of transactions made by European credit cardholders in September 2013. Each transaction is labeled as fraud (1) or non-fraud (0). The dataset is highly imbalanced, with very few fraudulent cases.

- **Columns:**  
    - `Time`: Seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
    - `Amount`: Transaction amount.
    - `Class`: Target variable (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).

## 🛠️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Handle imbalances with potential techniques like undersampling or oversampling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualize the distribution of fraud and non-fraud transactions.
   - Plot relationships between features and the target variable.
3. **Modeling and Evaluation:**  
   - Train a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
4. **Observations & Summary:**  
   - Document observations and suggest future steps.

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- **Class Distribution:** Distribution of fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.
- **Time and Amount Distributions:** Explore how transaction time and amount differ between classes.
- **Correlation Matrix:** Analyze correlations among features to detect patterns.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smebad/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
   cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
   ```
## 📈 Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved reasonable accuracy, although it faces challenges with class imbalance. Future work could involve trying alternative models and incorporating balancing techniques.

## 📌 Observations
* Fraudulent transactions tend to have lower transaction amounts.
* The dataset has strong class imbalance, necessitating further balancing for improved model accuracy.
* Logistic Regression provides a starting point for fraud detection, with potential for further enhancements.

## 📝 Future Improvements
* Explore other models, such as Random Forests or Decision Trees, to enhance detection accuracy.
* Experiment with feature engineering to improve the model's performance.
